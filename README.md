## Usage Examples

Below is a detailed guide on what you can accomplish with Guardy:

   - Example: www.youtube.com
2. **Try sneaking an external bot into the group**. It will be automatically removed.
3. **Try forwarding any message from outside the chat**. See it disappear before causing any harm.
4. **Imagine you are a scammer and send a malicious message to the group**. A community voting process will initiate, and a democratic community vote decides its fate.
   - Example: Congratulations ðŸŽ‰ You've won $1,000,000 in the Global Lottery. Claim your prize in our Telegram group ASAP!
5. **Ask anything about Guardy himself via @GuardyShieldBot**.
   - Example: @GuardyShieldBot who is your main developer?

    ```

2. **Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your configuration:**

    ```dotenv
    ENVIRONMENT=test 
    
    OPENAI_API_KEY=''
    OPENAI_GUARDY_ASSISTANT_ID=''
    OPENAI_GUARDY_ASSISTANT_API_KEY=''

## Deploy

## Important Notes

To ensure the security and proper functioning of your Telegram bot, a couple of best practices before deploying in production:

- **Use a `.dockerignore` file** to keep the build context clean and secure. Exclude unnecessary files that could expose sensitive information.
- **NEVER hard-code API keys or other sensitive data** in your code. Use environment variables and secure vaults to manage sensitive information.
- **Encrypt sensitive data** both at rest and in transit. Use HTTPS for all communications and consider encrypting data stored in your database.
- **Limit permissions and access** to only those who need it. Use role-based access controls to manage user permissions effectively.
- **Implement logging and monitoring** to detect and respond to security incidents promptly. Monitor your bot for unusual activity.
- **Regularly review your code** and conduct security audits to identify and fix vulnerabilities.
- **Implement data retention policies** to manage the lifecycle of the data your bot collects. Ensure compliance with data protection regulations in your region.
